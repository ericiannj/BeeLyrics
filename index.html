              Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed. My interior world needs to
              sanitize. I've got to step through or I'll dissipate. I'll record
              my step through for my basement tapes
            </p>

            <p>
              Nice to know my kind will be on my side. I don't believe the hype.
              And you know you're a terrible sight. But you'll be just fine.
              Just don't believe the hype
            </p>

            <p>
              Yeah, they might be talking behind your head. Your exterior world
              can step off instead. It might take some friends and a warmer
              shirt. But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt.
